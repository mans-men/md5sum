# md5sum
c++ implementation of md5sum algorithm, this version is slower than the md5sum command on linux, if anyone knows how to optimize,please give me our advice.

   2. get md5 digest of your file ```./md5 your_file_path```
* Windows
   1. run  command in cmd :```g++ -std=c++11 md5.cpp -o md5.exe```
